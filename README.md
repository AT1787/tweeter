Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. The project has a primary focus on front end development as a dynamic single page application with the use of jQuery, HTML, and CSS. It was developed to be 'mobie first', and was coded with principles of responsive design in mind to accommodate larger resolutions (768px and 1024px)
